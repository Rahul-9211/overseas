Your resume puts forward your most important skills and accomplishments to inform the HR manager that you are the right candidate for the role.
Resumes also offer an effective way for you to assess your career trajectory and skills to make suitable adjustments or additions to them as per the demand in the industry. It is your first impression to the recruiter and helps them decide whether to invite you to interview. Writing a strong resume typically requires planning and understanding what the hiring managers are looking for, as it can be difficult to detail every single aspect of your work experience within one or two pages.`,
